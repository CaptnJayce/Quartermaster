# Quartermaster | Assistive AI

## Introduction
Quartermaster is a personal AI Assistant written in Python. It uses a variety of Python libraries to help with web scraping, TTS/STT, media control, and more. 

To prevent overscoping the initial development of this project, I am sticking with the three aforementioned uses and will expand it more when I believe it is in a useable state. 

## Install and Setup
Eventually, I will turn this into an application so it's usable for any user, but for now:

Ensure pip is installed and that you are in the correct directory after cloning

Run command:\
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then:\
```python main.py```

## Current Features
Media control\
Web scraping\
(Decent) Conversational ability\
Text to Speech & Speech to Text

## Upcoming Features
System control, so that it can create, modify, delete, and open files upon request.

Choice between terminal control and a GUI.
