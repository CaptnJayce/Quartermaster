TODO:
- The web_search works, but doesnt comply with google TOS. Will need to seek alternative
- When saying "QT" a timeframe will occur where it doesn't need to be said again to continue the conversation. Similar to Siri. 
- Add commands for:
    - Quit
    - Restart (maybe)
    - Create file
    - Modify file
    - Will add more later 
  
- Modify the prompt further
